                <h4>Geographical features</h4>
            </div>
            <p>
                The region Drimkol occupies the southwest region of the Republic of Macedonia. Drimkol is divided in Gorni and Dolni. Dolni or Debarski Drimkol is the area where are located the villages: Jablanica, Lakavica, Piskupshtina, Bezevo, Nerezi, Gorno and Dolno Lukovo, Modric and Drenok. The villages of Dolni Drimkol are set around small streams and springs, with the exception of Lukovo which is located on an expanse in the upper part of river Drim. The village Jablanica is found at the low part of the river.
                The west border of Dolni Drimkol includes the mountain Jablanica. The border follows the very crest of the mountain i.e the border line with Republic of Albania that passes above the villages Jablanica and Lakavica. It starts at the height Veternik (1369m a.s.l), continues towards southwest over Cer and Orlov kamen on Raduch (2084m a.s.l), and from there along the old border between the villages Jablanica, Lakavica and Steblevo, from Raduch on Sokolec, descends to the place Div Kosten on Lakajchka river, and from Div Kosten on south to Nezirova Tumba, and to Nevestin Grob and Strizhak.
                The south border heads diagonally from Strizak towards east, and up over the village Borovec and through the spring Bigor exits to the river Drim, all the way to the mouth of Jablanicka river, it ascends through Gjurkin Kamen on Lokovski Rid and, through Crvena Karpa and Lipokj, descends again to the river Drim at Modricki bridge and continues to the river Crn Drim. On this right side of the river there are no villages, only on the north side of Lokovski Rid that belongs to the villages Nerezi and Lukovo.
                On the north, towards Drenok, the border follows the flow of the Drim to the place Porta, from there to Gorna Krasta and Senishte, and to Veternik, that way the village Modric i.e the Dolni Drimkol is left with the whole hill Filipica.
                North and west of Dolni Drimkol is located the site Golo Brdo, on south Gorni Drimkol, and on east, over the river Drim, Karaorman and Strushka Malesija.

            <h4>The Name</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
            The name derives from the name of the river Drim and from the turkish term "kol". Concerning the name of the river Drim, it can also be said that it has a pre-slovenian root, probably from Celtic origin. 
            Actually, that name can be linked to the word "drem" that in scottish means "river that whisks", which is the exact case with Drim when it undertakes and waves the south wind.
            In administrative sense, the turkish term "kol" is not entirely clear. 
            Probably it means smallest  administrative, management unit, smaller than nahia (nahija), which didn't have its independence.
            More specifically, in the time of the ruling of the Turks the kazis (kazi) were divided into nahii, and the nahii into smaller administrative units - kol ( Budinoski 1998:143).
            There are no precise written documents according to which it would be known how exactly Drimkol was called before the arrival of the Turks, it is believed that it was called Podgor.
            In the ХI century Drimkol  is mentioned together with Debar and Reka as Agnoandika.

                <h4>A little history</h4>
            </div>
            <p>
                The Roman historic Polybius gives information about the fights between the Macedonians and the Illyrians in the Ohrid lake and states that the king Philip II conquered Enhalon, Struga in the year 334. 
                In this area we also come across the places with the following toponyms: Gradishta in v. Modrich, Kale in v. Piskupshtina, Chengene Kale in v. Lukovo and Latinski Dobje in v. Nerezi, where even today there are remains of walls that show that they used to represent certain settlements.
                In the year 148 the city Enhalon - Struga - fell under the power of the Romans, who built the known road Via Egnatia in order to connect Rome, through Durres and Thessaloniki, with Bizant.<br>
                <img class="inTextRight" src="images/ddr/via_egnatia.png" alt="Via Egnatia">
                In the area of Dolni Drimkol on a few locations there are remains of the road Via Egnatia, that passed through Kafasan on Jablanica mountain, penetrated the Struga valley, bypassing the swamp at Struga it surfaced by the entrance at the village Dobovjani, and then it passed the river Drim towards Ohrid. At Dobovjani one part turned north through Dolni Drimkol towards Debar and North Albania (Struga and Strushko 1970:42). At that time the city Enhalon exported agricultural and livestock products to the other areas of the Roman empire, and imported objects for practical use. The Romans ruled these areas until the IV century. Then the area of Ohrid was added to the province of Epirus. So the road represented  basic arthery for normal life of the inhabitants of these areas in Roman times. According to one folk tale about the place called Vojskin in the v. Jablanica it is said that there was stationed a roman military settlement which defended the road Via Egnatia from the attacks of bandits across the ravine of Drim ( Lekoski 1985:16).
